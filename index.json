You can do this manually by calling\n`Authentication.getRefreshToken` or use a helper function which automatically\nrefreshes the authentication when the tokens validity runs out.\n\nYou can use this to autorefresh before any API call:\n\n```fsharp\nAuthentication.withAutoRefresh(Games.getAvailableGamesForSearch search) authentication\n```\n"},{"uri":"https://nicoviii.github.io/GogApi.DotNet/explanations/overview.html","title":"Overview","content":"\n# Overview\n\nThe project **GogApi.DotNet** aims at providing an interface to use the (unofficial) GOG API from .NET.\nAt the moment the focus lies on F#.\n\nLike the README states it uses the knowledge from\n<https://www.gog.com/forum/general/unofficial_gog_api_documentation/page1> |\n<https://gogapidocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> but\nI don't rule out the possibility to further extend this (and hopefully contribute\nit to linked documentation) by own investigations.\n\nThis documentation contains always info about the currently available stable release\nof this project.
